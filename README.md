# LocoListen

A web application that can connect users around the world through music of similar taste, LocoListen utilizes Python to allow users to see the top 10 closest songs and albums of their area, promoting globalization of music.

LocoListen allows users to upload song links or playlist links, utilizing the Spotify API. Our database will then grab the data received along with the user's location, displaying it accordingly. 

LocoListen uses streamlit, pandas, plotly, numpy, and venv in order to run. This application was created for a hackathon, so these dependencies must be installed locally.
